<h1>7 facts about the 7 Wonders of the World</h1>
</head>
<body>
<div class="1">
    <h2>The Colossus of Rhodes</h2>
    <p>Built in c.290 BC, overlooking the harbour on the Greek island of Rhodes, this enormous statue was more than 30m tall but stood for just 56 years before it was toppled in an earthquake.</p>

</div>
<div class="2">
    <h2>The Great Pyramid at Giza</h2>
    <p>Built in c.2560 BC by the Old Kingdom pharaoh Khufu, this is the oldest and largest of the pyramids that make up the ancient Egyptian necropolis at Giza, just outside Cairo – now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

    </p>
</div>
<div class="3">
    <h2>The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</h2>
    <p>The final resting place of Mausolos of Caria, a 4th-century BC satrap (regional governor) of the Persian Empire, and his sister/wife Artemisia. It is said to have been some 45m tall, its walls decorated with sculpted reliefs, and its pyramidal roof crowned with a huge quadriga – a statue of four horses pulling a chariot.</p>
</div>
<div class="4">
    <h2>The Lighthouse of Alexandria</h2>
    <p>Built on the island of Pharos between 280 and 247 BC, it stood between 120m and 140m tall and was commissioned by Ptolemy I, one of the Macedonian successors of Alexander the Great, to help guide sailors into Alexandria’s harbour.</p>
</div>
<div class="5">
    <h2>The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus</h2>
    <p>The original temple was destroyed in a flood in the 7th century BC and its reconstruction burned down by the fame-hungry Herostratus (from whom we get ‘herostratic fame’ – seeking notoriety for its own sake) in c.356 BC. The third and largest phase, begun in 323 BC, created a temple 450ft long by 225ft wide and 60 ft high, with more than 127 columns. It met its final end amidst Gothic raids in AD 268.</p>
</div>
<div class="6">
    <h2>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h2>
    <p>According to Classical sources, the gardens were built by Nebuchadnezzar II (r.605-562 BC) to comfort his homesick wife, Amytis, who missed the plants of her homeland, Media.</p>
</div>
<div class="7">
    <h2>The Statue of Zeus at Olympia</h2>
    <p>Created in c. 432 BC, this enormous chryselephantine (ivory and gold-plated bronze) statue of the seated god – housed in the temple at his sanctuary at Olympia – was some 12m tall.</p>
